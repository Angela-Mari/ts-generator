# Taylor Swift Caption Generator
This project came out of a need to procrastinate on other projects _and_ because I am constantly looking for Taylor Swift lyrics to caption my life. 

## V2.0
In this update the app was built to deploy on my blog instead of heroku. The app was also optimized for mobile. A new github repo was created to disconnect from the heroku deployment cycle and debug some deployment issues.

## Lyrics Source

I found the complete list of TS lyrics at this [awesome repo](https://github.com/shaynak/taylor-swift-lyrics)!

## Deployed

This project is deployed on [my blog](https://angelageorge.com/ts-generator/)!

## If You Clone This
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

You know... react stuff

## Some Notes

* I'm kinda obsessed with this web app
* I hope TS doesn't sue me
* I wish I had made this earlier
